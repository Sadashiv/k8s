Containers:

Let us say python app to be deployed.
Need to install python every development environment

Define a container with Dockerfile
Dockerfile defines what goes on in the environment inside your container.
Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this environment,
which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you need to map ports to the outside world,
and be specific about what files you want to “copy in” to that environment. However,
after doing that, you can expect that the build of your app defined in this Dockerfile behaves exactly the same wherever it runs.

Run the app
Run the app, mapping your machine’s port 4000 to the container’s published port 80 using -p:

docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello
