Deployment
==========
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods. By default, it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max surge).

For example, if you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first creates a new Pod, then deletes an old Pod,
and creates another new one. It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of new Pods have come up,
and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed. It makes sure that at least 3 Pods are available
and that at max 4 Pods in total are available. In case of a Deployment with 4 replicas, the number of Pods would be between 3 and 5.
