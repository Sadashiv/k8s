Deployment
==========
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

Deployment also ensures that only a certain number of Pods are created above the desired number of Pods. By default,
it ensures that at most 125% of the desired number of Pods are up (25% max surge).

For example, if you look at the above Deployment closely, you will see that it first creates a new Pod, then deletes an old Pod,
and creates another new one. It does not kill old Pods until a sufficient number of new Pods have come up,
and does not create new Pods until a sufficient number of old Pods have been killed. It makes sure that at least 3 Pods are available
and that at max 4 Pods in total are available. In case of a Deployment with 4 replicas, the number of Pods would be between 3 and 5.

Replica set is indicidual, better to use deployment which contians the replica set

Using StatefulSets 
StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

Stable, unique network identifiers.
Stable, persistent storage.
Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
Ordered, automated rolling updates.


DaemonSet
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod
